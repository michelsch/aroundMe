# aroundMe

aroundMe is a web application I wrote to learn React, and add to my projects. It displays a grid of Flickr images taken around a default location, which you can change using a Google autocomplete form.


Instructions:
npm install
npm start
go to localhost:8080 on your browser.

Notes: When it loads pictures, you might notice a lot of flickering - this is expected but unintended; it's due to the constant reloading of differently sized images without throttling... which could/will be improved in a later version.
